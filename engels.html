            <h2> ABOUT A CAMPINGFLIGHT TO LOWLANDS PARADISE </h2>
            <h3> When and where is Lowlands 2019?</h3>
            <p>Lowlands takes place on August 16 + 17 + 18, 2019 at Evenemententerrein Walibi Holland at Biddinghuizen, The Netherlands. Click here to find our location on Google Maps. You can arrive at Thursday August 15 from 9:00 AM in the morning and leave at Monday August 19 at noon. </p>

            <h3>What is Lowlands? </h3>
            <p> A Campingflight To Lowlands Paradise is exactly what it promises to be: a true backpacker’s Garden Of Eden and Holland’s most adventurous cultural outdoorevent, offering a cutting edge choice of only the best in alternative music, film, stand-up comedy, visual arts, literature and street theatre.
                For three days in August, a township with 60,000 inhabitants arises in the middle of the country. The Lowlands festival hosts no less than twelve stages in three large areas (among which a cinema and theatre), about 250 different acts and performances, dozens of restaurants from all corners of the earth, food and drink stalls, a large market with everything from clothes and CD stores to a barber’s shop, relax rooms with brain massages, sports facilities, a sauna / hottub area, its own currency, a local radio station, a daily newspaper (Dutch only) and, last but not least: seven luxury campsites with hot showers and real, flushable toilets. A Campingflight To Lowlands Paradise really is the ultimate summer holiday extravaganza!
